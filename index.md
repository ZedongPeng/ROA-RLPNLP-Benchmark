### Alternative Regularizations for Outer-Approximation Algorithms for Convex MINLP

The PAVER reports used in the paper: "Alternative Regularizations for Outer-Approximation Algorithms for Convex MINLP" by D.E. Bernal, Z. Peng, J. Kronqvist and I.E. Grossmann are available here.

1. There are two problem set in this benchmark, Problem Set 1 and Problem Set 2. 
    - Problem Set 1 constains 438 convex instances from MINLPLib, which have at least one discrete variable and at least one continuous variable. 
    - Problem Set 2 contains 135 highly nonlinear instances.
